  <a>A turn based RPG that features an infinitely generated world, open world faction system, and emergent gameplay.
  The game world is generated into chunks of biomes through perlin noise, with the individual world tiles using a combination
  of BSP generation and walker algorothims.  A generalized AI system combined with the faction system allows for creatures
  to pick and choose their targets between the player and NPCs allowing for a world that feels open and alive.</a>
  <h3>Heat Death</h3>

  <a href="https://www.github.com/jmackellar/HeatDeath">Github</a></br>
  <a>An action game set in space.  The player object and enemy objects are identical, meaning the enemies may use any attack, item,
  or spell that the player may and use, and vice versa.  The creature objects are controlled through a state and animation system 
  where each part of the body is tracked seperately and moved accordingly to allow for different states to be combined with different
  game items.</a>
  <h3>Immorlands</h3>
  <a>2018</a>
  <a href="https://www.github.com/jmackellar/Immorlands">Github</a></br>
  <a>An action RPG about exploring a dungeon underneath a cave.  The object state system, UI framework, and dynamic lighting effects 
  used in Heat Death were originally written for this project before being updated and improved upon.</a>
